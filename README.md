## ðŸ“Š Company Sales Data Repository

### Project Name

**Sales Data Management & Analysis**

### Overview

This repository contains datasets, scripts, and documentation for storing, managing, and analyzing company sales data. The purpose is to support business and data analysts in making data-driven decisions by tracking sales trends, product performance, seasonal patterns, and identifying both anomalies and growth opportunities.

### Repository Structure

* **Datasets**

  * Sales transactions (orders, products, customers, dates, markets)
  * Product master and category data
  * Customer information (segments, demographics)
* **Scripts & Code**

  * `ETL/` â€” extraction, transformation, and loading processes
  * `analysis/` â€” data analysis, statistics, and visualization
  * `modeling/` â€” predictive modeling and sales forecasting
  * `sql/` â€” SQL queries for table joins and aggregations
  * `notebooks/` â€” Jupyter notebooks for interactive exploration
* **Documentation**

  * `README.md` â€” project overview and usage guide
  * `DATA_DICT.md` â€” data dictionary explaining each column
  * `CONTRIBUTING.md` â€” contribution guidelines
  * `LICENSE` â€” project license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0)

### Key Features

* Aggregated sales reports by daily, weekly, and monthly periods
* Trend and seasonality analysis
* Product, category, and regional performance evaluation
* Customer insights (lifetime value, purchase frequency)
* Future sales forecasting using predictive models
* Outlier detection (e.g., sudden spikes or drops in sales)
* Interactive dashboards (optional: Power BI, Tableau, Streamlit)

### Technology Stack

* Programming: Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, statsmodels)
* Databases: MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite
* Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
* Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Streamlit, Dash
* Version control: Git + GitHub

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/project-name.git
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Import the dataset into a local database using the ETL scripts
4. Run the notebooks in the `analysis/` or `modeling/` folder
5. Adjust the SQL queries in `sql/` to match your database schema

### Notes

* Ensure consistent date format (YYYY-MM-DD) for smooth joins and analysis
* Normalize tables (transactions, dates, products) to simplify queries
* Handle missing or duplicate records carefully
* Provide clear documentation for reproducibility and collaboration
